            <p>
                For a time I stood, relishing my autumn night.<br>
                Amy hated wordless nighttime walking intensely<br>
                  and so had strutted home dourly.<br>
                "I'm rather cold," she had muttered, "and so…goodbye."<br><br>
                Welcoming night surrounded me; lukewarm droplets fell.<br>
                I continued walking. I passed gentlemen<br>
                  and derelicts wandering the streets alone.<br>
                I considered their fortunes, my misfortune.<br><br>
                Reviewing various past incidents<br>
                (lost love, women discarded,<br>
                  my old residences, careers, comrades)<br>
                I walked past mysterious alleys to<br>
                  suddenly arrive at Blackwood's Bookshop.<br>
                Dignified bookworms searched stacks of inviting paperbacks.<br>
                And then, suddenly, my stare met hers.<br><br>
                "Um…I…I…"<br>
                "Quickly, sweetheart, softly! Outside!"<br><br>
                Strangely enjoying it, I went,<br>
                  somewhat bewildered although surely happy.<br>
                I sat so silently as she approached.<br>
                Coming closer, then bending delicately alongside,<br>
                she tenderly said,<br><br>
                This strong, pronounced technique which style constrains
                Shall delegate to me, now I believe,
                An earth for loves unleashed like hurricanes;
                Herewith I do innately this perceive.<br><br>
                "I…I…," I giddily said again, resembling an absolute fool.<br>
                I spluttered, "I'm awfully ridiculous.<br>
                  I apologize for babbling again."<br>
                So I (a blithering idiot) spoke, while everybody stared.<br><br>
                "Hush, hush! Listen up! Go instantly home.<br>
                Remember important stuff:<br>
                Love, integrity, art, literature," she lectured.<br><br>
                I entreated softly, "Your name is…?"<br>
                Suddenly, silently, a driverless limousine stopped,<br>
                doors neatly marked "Muses Unlimited."<br>
                She was gone.
