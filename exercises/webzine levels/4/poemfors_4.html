<h3>A Poem for S.</h3>
<p>
    <b>B</b>ecause you used to leaf through the dictionary,&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    <b>C</b>asually, as someone might in a barber shop, and&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    <b>D</b>evotedly, as someone might in a sanctuary,&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    <b>E</b>ach letter would still have your attention if not&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    <b>F</b>or the responsibilities life has tightly fit, like&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    <b>G</b>ears around the cog of you, like so many petals&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    <b>H</b>inged on a daisy. That’s why I’ll just use your&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    <b>I</b>nitial. Do you know that in one treasured story, a&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    <b>J</b>ewish ancestor, horseback in the woods at Yom&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    <b>K</b>ippur, and stranded without a prayer book,&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    <b>L</b>ooked into the darkness and realized he had&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    <b>M</b>erely to name the alphabet to ask forgiveness—&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    <b>N</b>o congregation of figures needed, he could speak&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    <b>O</b>ne letter at a time because all of creation&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    <b>P</b>roceeded from those. He fed his horse, and then&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    <b>Q</b>uietly, because it was from his heart, he&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    <b>R</b>ecited them slowly, from aleph to tav. Within those&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    <b>S</b>ounds, all others were born, all manner of&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    <b>T</b>rials, actions, emotions, everything needed to&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    <b>U</b>nderstand who he was, had been, how flaws&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    <b>V</b>enerate the human being, how aspirations return&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    <b>W</b>ithout spite. Now for you, may your wife’s&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    <b>X</b>-ray return with good news, may we raise our&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    <b>Z</b>arfs to both your names in the Great Book of Life.
