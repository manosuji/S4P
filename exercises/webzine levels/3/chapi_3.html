        Chapter I.<br><br>
        Writing
        is inhibiting.
        Sighing, I sit,
        scribbling in ink this pidgin script.
        I sing with nihilistic witticism, disciplining
        signs with trifling gimmicks—impish hijinks which highlight stick sigils.
        
        Isn't it glib?
        Isn't it chic?
        
        I fit childish insights within rigid limits, writing shtick which might instill priggish misgivings in critics blind with hindsight. I dismiss nitpicking criticism which flirts with philistinism. I bitch; I kibitz—griping whilst criticizing dimwits, sniping whilst indicting nitwits, dismissing simplistic thinking, in which philippic wit is still illicit.
