<h3>A Poem for S.</h3>
<p>
    Because you used to leaf through the dictionary,&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    Casually, as someone might in a barber shop, and&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    Devotedly, as someone might in a sanctuary,&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    Each letter would still have your attention if not&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    For the responsibilities life has tightly fit, like&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    Gears around the cog of you, like so many petals&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    Hinged on a daisy. That’s why I’ll just use your&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    Initial. Do you know that in one treasured story, a&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    Jewish ancestor, horseback in the woods at Yom&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    Kippur, and stranded without a prayer book,&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    Looked into the darkness and realized he had&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    Merely to name the alphabet to ask forgiveness—&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    No congregation of figures needed, he could speak&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    One letter at a time because all of creation&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    Proceeded from those. He fed his horse, and then&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    Quietly, because it was from his heart, he&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    Recited them slowly, from aleph to tav. Within those&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    Sounds, all others were born, all manner of&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    Trials, actions, emotions, everything needed to&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    Understand who he was, had been, how flaws&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    Venerate the human being, how aspirations return&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    Without spite. Now for you, may your wife’s&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    X-ray return with good news, may we raise our&nbsp;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
    Zarfs to both your names in the Great Book of Life.
